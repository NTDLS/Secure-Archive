In cryptography, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known as Rijndael, is a block cipher
adopted as an encryption standard by the U.S. government. It has been analysed extensively and is
now used worldwide, as was the case with its predecessor,[3] the Data Encryption Standard (DES).
AES was announced by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as U.S. FIPS PUB 197
(FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001 after a 5-year standardization process (see Advanced Encryption
Standard process for more details). It became effective as a standard May 26, 2002. As of 2006,
AES is one of the most popular algorithms used in symmetric key cryptography. It is available by
choice in many different encryption packages. This marks the first time that the public has had
access to a cipher approved by NSA for top secret information.

Serpent was a finalist in the AES competition. The winner, Rijndael, got 86 votes at the last AES
conference while Serpent got 59 votes, Twofish 31 votes, RC6 23 votes and MARS 13 votes.
</p>

<p align=justify>
The cipher was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen,
and submitted to the AES selection process under the name "Rijndael", a portmanteau of
the names of the inventors.

Unlike DES, its predecessor, AES is a substitution-permutation network, not a Feistel network.
AES is fast in both software and hardware, is relatively easy to implement, and requires little memory.
As a new encryption standard, it is currently being deployed on a large scale.
