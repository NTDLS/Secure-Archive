<b>US Dept of Defense Standard 5220.22-M</b><br />
<b>National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual Description:</b><br />
<br />

Section 5. Software and Data Files........................................................8-5-1<br />
<br />

Subsection 8-5-3:<br />
<b>1.</b> Overwriting Media. Overwriting is a software procedure that replaces the data previously
stored on magnetic storage media with a predefined set of meaningless data. Overwriting is
an acceptable method for clearing. Only approved overwriting software that is compatible
with the specific hardware intended for overwriting will be used. Use of such software will
be coordinated in advance with the Customer. The success of the overwrite procedure will be
verified through random sampling of the overwritten media. The effectiveness of the overwrite
procedure may be reduced by several factors: ineffectiveness of the overwrite procedures,
equipment failure (e.g., misalignment of read/write heads), or inability to overwrite bad
sectors or tracks or information in inter-record gaps. To clear magnetic disks, overwrite
all locations three (3) times (first time with a character, second time with its complement,
and the third time with a random character). Items which have been cleared must remain at the
previous level of classification and remain in a secure, controlled environment.<br />
<b>2.</b> Overwriting Procedure. The preferred method to clear magnetic disks is to overwrite all
locations three (3) times (the first time with a random character, the second time with a specified
character, the third time with the complement of that specified character).<br />
<b>3.</b> Sanitizing Media. Sanitization removes information from media such that data recovery using
any known technique or analysis is prevented. Sanitizing is a two-step process that includes
removing data from the media in accordance with Table 3 and removing all classified labels,
 markings, and activity logs.

<br />

<b>DISPOSITION OF SENSITIVE AUTOMATED INFORMATION</b><br />
Sanitization means the removal of data from storage media so that, for all practical purposes,
the data cannot be retrieved. Some instances in which sanitization must be considered include
whenever media is transferred from one organization to another, when equipment is declared surplus,
and when organizations dispose of media.<br />

<br />

<b>Sanitization: Why Be Concerned?</b><br />
In the past, reports have surfaced that federal agencies have disposed of surplus information
technology (IT) equipment without taking appropriate measures to erase the information stored
on the system’s media. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, embarrassment
to the agency, costly investigations, and other consequences which could have been avoided.<br />

<br />

Employees throw away old diskettes believing that “erasing” the files on the diskette has made
the data unretrievable. In reality, however, “erasing” a file simply removes the “pointer” to
that file. The pointer tells the computer where the file is physically stored on the disk.
Without this pointer, the files will not appear on a directory listing of the diskette's files.
This does not mean that the file was removed from the diskette. (Commonly available utility
programs can often retrieve information that is presumed “deleted.”) Fortunately, with foresight
and appropriate planning, these situations can be avoided.<br />

<br />

<b>Techniques for Media Sanitization</b><br />
Three techniques are commonly used for media sanitization: overwriting, degaussing, and destruction.
Overwriting and degaussing are the methods recommended for disposition of sensitive automated information.
(Users of classified systems may also have to be concerned with data remanence. This refers to the residual
information left behind once media has been in some way erased.) Security officers should be consulted for
appropriate guidance.<br />

<br />

<b>Overwriting</b><br />
Overwriting is an effective method of clearing data from magnetic media. As the name implies, overwriting
utilizes a program to write (1s, 0s, or a combination of both) onto the location of the media where the
file to be sanitized is located. The number of times that media is overwritten depends on the level of
sensitivity of the information. Overwriting should not be confused with merely deleting the pointer to a
file, as discussed above.<br />

<br />

<b>Degaussing</b><br />
Degaussing is a method to magnetically erase data from magnetic media. Two types of degaussers exist:
strong magnets and electric degaussers. Degaussers are tested by the Department of Defence; those which
meet their requirements are placed on the Degausser Products List (DPL) of the National Security Agency’s
(NSA) Information Systems Security Products and Services Catalogue.<br />

<br />

<b>Destruction</b><br />
The final method of sanitization is destruction of the media. NCSC-TG-025 provides specifics on this
method and its applicability. Shredding diskettes, after removing the outer protective casing, is also
an option for unclassified media.<br />

<br />

<b>Employee Training and Awareness</b><br />
Most employees who utilize IT systems also use, and in fact are often the custodians of, magnetic
media. It is therefore important for agencies to give the issue of media sanitization appropriate
attention in the agency computer security training and awareness program.<br />

<br />

<b>Employees should understand the following essential elements:</b><br />
<b>1.</b> Media containing sensitive information should not be released without appropriate sanitization.<br />
<b>2.</b> File deletion functions (e.g., the DEL command on MS-DOS) usually can be expected to remove only
    the pointer to a file (i.e., the file is often still recoverable).<br />
<b>3.</b> When data is removed from storage media, every precaution should be taken to remove duplicate
    versions that may exist on the same or other storage media, back-up files, temporary files, hidden
    files, or extended memory.<br />
<b>4.</b> Media in surplus equipment should be sanitized.<br />
